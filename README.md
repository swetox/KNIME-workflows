# KNIME-TK-workflows
Workflows for prediction of inhalation toxicokinetics from chemical/moleuclar structure, including the workflows for the individual steps in the developmental process. The cohesive workflows come in three versions: single exposure setup, multiple exposure setups and HFC exposure setups.

The work file "Installation guide for KNIME.docx" provides a guide for installation of KNIME and the appropriate settings and other programs needed for running the workflows. This should be read and followed before downloading workflows.
