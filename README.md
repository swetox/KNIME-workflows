# KNIME-TK-workflows
Workflows for prediction of inhalation toxicokinetics from chemical structure, including the workflows creating during the developmental process. The cohesive workflows come in three versions: single exposure scenario, multiple scenarios and HFC scenarios.

The work file "Installation guide for KNIME.docx" provides a guide for installation of KNIME and the appropriate settings and other prorams needed for running the workflows. This should be read and followed before downloading workflows.
